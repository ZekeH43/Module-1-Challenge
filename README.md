# Case Study
# Ripple

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
* The name of the company I will be doing my case study on is Ripple. Ripple, also known to some people as XRP, is a company that works in real time cross border payments as well as in the cryptocurrency space.

* When was the company incorporated?
* Ripple began back in 2011 when the founders first created a ledger for the token that they use known as XRP. By 2012 an angel investor named Chris Larsen had joined them and they launched it as Newcoin. Over the next couple years they changed the name to Opencoin and finally settled on Ripple in 2015.

* Who are the founders of the company?
* The founders of Ripple are David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britt.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
* The idea for the company came about when the founders discovered what bitcoin was. They wanted to then develop a better version of Bitcoin that they could use for payments specifically and was more sustainable to run on the blockchain.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
* After the founders created the XRP ledger and launched it in 2011, they then donated $80 billion XRP tokens to then Opencoin. Ripple then put the tokens in escrow allowing them to profit from the sale of the tokens. Ripple has also done 7 rounds of funding from investors totaling $275 million from individuals and institutions. 


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
* Ripple's main goal is to help companies utilize the XRP ledger to make simple baking transactions like sending and receiving money faster, cheaper and more reliable. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
* The intended customer for this product is big banks and companies that process payments internationally. It is tough to say the market size because banks, companies and individuals all around the world can utilize Ripple in different ways. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
* The biggest solution that Ripple offers is they are able to settle payments in as little as three to five seconds and for less than a penny. Whereas their competitor Bitcoin takes up to 500 seconds to settle payments and costs fifty cents. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
* As found on stack share, Ripple is utilizing many tools such as JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, Java, NGINX, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Google Drive, Amazon S3, to do everyday business.


## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
* Ripple would go under payments and remittances because they are selling a product that you can send and receive payments in real time. I could also see them going under block chain and cryptocurrency because the platform they use for their payment process utilizes both a blockchain and cryptocurrency.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
* From the beginning Ripple has always strived to create a faster payment process through either cross border payments or settlements and they have been very successful doing that and pushing other platforms to step up and try to compete. Another major trend they have started is Ripple does not use mining for XRP settlements, making them more ecofriendly. Just mining one Bitcoin uses more energy than the average household uses in one year.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
* This domain has been rapidly growing due to the growth of technology and money being invested in it. In comparison with Ripple the major companies in this domain are Stellar also known as XLM, as well as Bitcoin. Stellar is similar because they deal with sending and receiving money on the block chain as well, but they market to just individuals.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
* On the business side Ripple has had the biggest impact in cross-border payments because settlements happen in as quick as three to five seconds whereas most other major companies take one to three days. They have also begun working with some financial institutions and helping them switch from using a middleman to using blockchain to send, verify and receive funds.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
* In this domain it is all about speed, cryptocurrency is supposed to be fast and efficient so all companies in this space will measure how many transactions per second they can do as a metric to see what they are capable of. Another metric that can improve speed is validators. Validators is someone who verifies a transaction on the blockchain and then is added on to a ledger of the blockchain. Ripple has done great by creating a process where they can do up to 1,500 transactions per second by having 120 validators. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
* 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* I would advise the company to become their own bank for small and big businesses. Yes this can get tricky for legal reasons but this opens up the door for them to take profits like banks do by investing the money they hold. They could also make banking more personal by offering customers the opportunity to store any crypto on cold wallets that they hold. Cold wallets allow you to store your crypto and not have to worry about someone stealing it or having access to it. They also already work with companies to utilize their platform for payroll so if they could speed this process up even faster by allowing companies to do payroll and send payments to make purchases in real time that are verified this would create more security for companies. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* This service would allow customers to pay their employees faster and efficiently. It would also create good relationships because businesses could pay vendors in just seconds.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Ripple utilizes technology already that would allow them to do this because they already deal with a ledger on blockchain.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
